# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company. The dataset includes customer demographics, account details, service usage, billing information, and churn status. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer attrition, highlight high-risk segments, and provide insights that can help improve retention strategies.

- Project Overview

Dataset: Includes customer demographics, account details, service usage (local & international calls, data usage), billing information, and churn status.

Churn Rate: ~26.9% of customers have churned, highlighting the need for predictive insights.

Analysis Scope:

Churn distribution by age group, account length, and international plan usage

Impact of customer service calls, billing methods, and contract types on churn

Identification of high-risk customer segments

- Dataset Structure

Overview: High-level churn statistics

Databel - Customer: Individual customer records (calls, plans, billing, churn label)

Databel - Aggregate: Aggregated metrics by state and customer groups

Churn Analysis: Churn breakdown by demographics (seniors, under 30, etc.)

Customer Pivots: Pivot tables summarizing churn metrics


- Key Outcomes

Identified high-risk groups (e.g., senior customers and those with international plans show higher churn).

Found that contract type and payment method strongly correlate with retention.

Built a foundation for churn prediction models to support targeted retention strategies.
